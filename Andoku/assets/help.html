<h1 id="objective">Objective</h1>

<p>The objective of the game is to fill the entire game grid so that
the digits from 1 to 9 appear exactly once in each <i>region</i>. For a
standard sudoku a <i>region</i> is either a row, a column or one of the
nine square 3x3 blocks.</p>

<h1 id="variants">Game Variants</h1>

<p>Andoku offers additional sudoku variants besides the classical
one. In the <i>New Game</i> menu you can choose from two grid styles and
four kinds of extra regions.</p>

<h2 id="grids">Grid Styles</h2>

<p>The available grid styles are:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Standard</dt>
	<dd>The grid is made up of square 3x3 blocks.</dd>
	<dt>Squiggly (a.k.a. jigsaw)</dt>
	<dd>Instead of 9 square blocks the game grid consists of 9
	non-square regions. The regions are outlined with a thick line and the
	digits 1 to 9 have to appear exactly once in each region.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="extras">Extra Regions</h2>

<p>Extra regions impose additional constraints on the puzzle. Aside
from the classic version there are three kinds of extra regions:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>None</dt>
	<dd>You only have to deal with nine rows, columns and (square or
	squiggly) blocks.</dd>
	<dt>X-Sudoku</dt>
	<dd>The digits 1 to 9 also have to appear exactly once in the two
	diagonals of the puzzle. To indicate this the diagonals have a light
	blue background color.</dd>
	<dt>Hyper-Sudoku</dt>
	<dd>The sudoku has four additional regions drawn in a light blue
	background color. In addition to rows, columns and blocks the digits 1
	to 9 have to appear exactly once in each of these extra regions.</dd>
	<dt>Percent-Sudoku</dt>
	<dd>The sudoku has three additional regions that resemble a
	percent sign.</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="difficulties">Difficulty Levels</h1>

<p>Andoku offers five difficulty levels per game type. The
difficulties range from <i>Easy</i> to <i>Fiendish</i>. Squiggly sudokus
or sudokus with extra regions are generally more difficult than standard
sudokus.</p>

<p>The difficulty levels <i>Hard</i> and <i>Fiendish</i> should
contain harder puzzles than what can be found in newspapers.</p>

<p>With eight different game types, five difficulty levels and 100
puzzles per type and difficulty Andoku offers a total of 4000 puzzles.</p>

<h1 id="inputmethods">Input Methods</h1>

<p>Andoku offers three different input methods for entering digits
into the cells of a puzzle while playing. Go to Settings to choose
between the available input methods.</p>

<h2 id="im_ctv">Cell Then Values</h2>

<p>With this input method you first select a cell by tapping on it
with your finger and then you use the numeric pad at the bottom of the
screen to enter one or more possible values for that cell. The currently
selected cell will be highlighted with a background color.</p>

<p>Press the button <tt>C</tt> to clear the values of the currently
selected cell.</p>

<p>The button <tt>Inv</tt> is used to reverse the values of the
current cell. This makes it possible to easily specify that certain
values are <i>not</i> possible at a certain cell. For example if you
enter <tt>3</tt>, <tt>7</tt>, <tt>Inv</tt> the result will be 1, 2, 4,
5, 6, 8 and 9 (all digits except 3 and 7).</p>

<p>If the device has a track ball it can be used move the selection
to one of the neighbor fields.</p>

<h2 id="im_vtc">Values Then Cell</h2>

<p>This input method works the opposite way around. First you select
one or more values from the numeric pad at the bottom of the screen.
Only then do you tap on a cell to assign these values to it.</p>

<p>This input method can save a lot of work because it is possible
to assign multiple fields to the same value or values by tapping on the
cells one after the other.</p>

<p>But what happens when you tap on a cell that is not empty? The
result depends on whether the cell already contained one of the selected
values or not. If the cell did not already contain one of the selected
values the values are simply added (same behavior as if the cell would
have been empty). If, on the other hand, the cell already contained one
of the selected values then all of the selected values will be reset
instead.</p>

<p>Example: cell values <tt>3</tt>, numeric pad <tt>5</tt>, <tt>7</tt>
results in 3, 5 and 7.</p>

<p>Example: cell values <tt>3</tt>, <tt>5</tt>, <tt>7</tt>, numeric
pad <tt>3</tt>, <tt>5</tt> results in 7.</p>

<p>Example: cell values <tt>3</tt>, <tt>5</tt>, numeric pad <tt>5</tt>,
<tt>8</tt> results in 3. I.e. 5 is cleared, but 8 is <i>not</i> set.</p>

<p>The button <tt>C</tt> is used to clear all values on the numeric
pad. The button <tt>Inv</tt> is used to reverse the values on the
numeric pad.</p>

<h2 id="im_auto">Automatic</h2>

<p>Use this input method if you want to easily switch back and forth
between <i>Cell Then Values</i> and <i>Values Then Cell</i>.</p>

<p>This means that initially both input methods are possible. If you
tap on a cell first then <i>Cell Then Values</i> will be used
automatically. If you tap on a digit of the numeric pad first then <i>Values
Then Cell</i> will be used instead.</p>

<p>If you want to get back to the neutral state from <i>Cell
Then Values</i> you have to tap on the selected cell a second time.</p>

<p>To get back from <i>Values Then Cell</i> you have to clear all
values on the numeric pad. The simplest way to do this is by pressing
the button <tt>C</tt>.</p>
