<h1>Objective</h1>

<p>The objective of the game is to fill the entire game grid so that the digits from 1 to 9
appear exactly once in each <i>region</i>. For a standard sudoku a <i>region</i> is either a
row, a column or one of the nine square 3x3 block.</p>

<h1>Game Variants</h1>

<p>Andoku offers additional sudoku variants besides the classical one.
In the <i>New Game</i> menu you can choose from two grid styles and three kinds
of extra regions.</p>

<h2>Grid Styles</h2>

<p>The available grid styles are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Standard</dt>
  <dd>The grid is made up of square 3x3 blocks.</dd>
  <dt>Squiggly (a.k.a. jigsaw)</dt>
  <dd>Instead of 9 square blocks the game grid consists of 9 non-square regions. The regions
  are outlined with a thick line and the digits 1 to 9 have to appear exactly once in each
  region.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Extra Regions</h2>

<p>Extra regions impose additional constraints on the puzzle. There are three
kinds of extra regions:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>None</dt>
  <dd>No extra regions. You only have to deal with 9 rows, nine columns and 9 (square or
  squiggly) blocks.</dd>
  <dt>X-Sudoku</dt>
  <dd>The digits 1 to 9 also have to appear exactly once in the two diagonals of the puzzle.
  To indicate this the diagonals have a light blue background color.</dd>
  <dt>Hyper-Sudoku</dt>
  <dd>The sudoku has four additional regions drawn in a light blue background color.
  In addition to rows, columns and blocks the digits 1 to 9 have to appear exactly
  once in each of these extra regions.</dd>
</dl>

<h1>Difficulty Levels</h1>

<p>Andoku offers five difficulty levels per game type. The difficulties range from
<i>Easy</i> to <i>Fiendish</i>. Squiggly sudokus or sudokus with extra regions
are generally more difficult than standard sudokus.</p>

<p>The difficulty levels <i>Hard</i> and <i>Fiendish</i> should contain harder puzzles
than what can be found in newspapers.</p> 

<p>With six different game types, five difficulty levels and 100 puzzles per type and
difficulty Andoku offers a total of 3000 puzzles.</p>
